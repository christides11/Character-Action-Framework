## Character Action Framework

**Character Action Framework** (or CAF) is a Unity-focused framework designed for making character action games. 

CAF's goal is to create a framework that handles most of the code that works similarly between games of this type, while also providing the ability to change any part of the framework easily. 

## Getting Started

TO get started, follow the guide [here](https://christides11.github.io/Character-Action-Framework/guides/index.html). This guide will walk you through installing the framework all the way to having a functional game running.

## Examples

Right now the project come with a 2D action game example, but it's a WIP.

Other than that, you can look at [Touhou Unlimited Fantasies](https://github.com/christides11/touhou-unlimited-fantasies) for an example too.
